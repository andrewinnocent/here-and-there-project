# Here & There!
## A Travel Journal App

“Here & There!” is my first full-stack project! I love traveling and would do it as often as possible. My travel bug started in college when I first studied abroad in France. Four months never flew by so quickly! Unfortunately, I didn’t take any notes about my experiences and my memory isn’t getting any better. Hence, the idea for this web app.

Here & There is a user-friendly app that allows someone to create journal entries of their travels in the USA (global locations for v. 2.0). They can rate their experience, view, delete, and update their saved entries. Anyone traveling and wanting to remember their travel experiences should use this app!

## Some Observations
1. This project I was more organized than the previous. I had a better idea of how long it would take to setup a straightforward API and testing the paths. That almost went without a hitch, but then reality. I spent more time on the front-end connecting to the API, particularly sending the right data through the Ajax request. PATCH and GET one entry took the longest. Lots of ‘console.log()’s where employed to grasp how to access and pass the appropriate data.

2. I used the issue queue more frequently than last project. There’s still room for improvement. I wasted half a day on trying to figure out how to index info to the DOM using jQuery instead of applying Handlebars.js right away. If I issue queued, I would’ve gotten to the solution much faster!

3. Searching Google well is an art. I've definitely improved throughout the bootcamp. My queries are much more pointed and therefore helped me to get to solutions quicker.

4. Web development is FUN! Hard, fun, and personally satisfying (especially when things work)!


## Version 2.0 Desires:
1. Interactive US/world map to input journal entry
2. Show entries by location ratings
3. MUCH better styling (really take advantage of what Bootstrap can do)
4. Create a photo library
5. Facebook like ability

Overall, I’m happy with this project! I hope you like it too :).
